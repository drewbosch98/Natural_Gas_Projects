2,"Inventory change is the difference between opening inventory and closing inventory."
3,"Other adjustments include discrepancies due to meter inaccuracies and/or leakage or other losses. Inventory adjustments can be a positive or negative value."
4,"In January 2016, the Monthly Natural Gas Storage Survey was created to provide measures on gas storage characteristics related to inventories and flows. Storage data is now available in table 25-10-0057-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0005). Data from releases prior to January 2016 will remain available for reference purposes in tables 25-10-0035-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0001), 25-10-0032-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0002), 25-10-0033-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0003) and 25-10-0034-01 (formerly CANSIM 129-0004). As a result of content and methodology changes, the current estimates may not be comparable with the estimates available in the Common Output Data Repository (CODR) previous to January 2016."
5,"As previous month closing inventory must equal current opening inventory, other adjustments absorb any differences in the conversion process.  This may result in opposing positive and negative values between units of measure."
